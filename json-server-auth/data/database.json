The system tracks potential intruders via advanced algorithms to manage cameras: any alarm is processed and associated with a list of possible intrusion hypotheses on the basis of an encoded set of rules. Power flow analyses estimate the impact of any attack scenario on the grid and suggest operational practices to limit the impact itself. A drill at CEPS premises provided raw data to validate the tool performance. \n\nThe tool provides early warning capabilities with respect to detecting physical intrusions in energy system facilities.

Although these attacks had been punctual and crude, more sophisticated attacks on dozens or hundreds of injured or killed people are conceivable. \n\nWhen launching such an attack its success depends on concentrating a sufficient amount of pathogens in a defined area. Hence safeguarding a certain area regarding biological agents demands the detection of pathogenous bacteria, spores and viruses in various matrices (e.g. Anthrax in flour or sugar) or suspicious aerosols. This can only be accomplished by triggering a short-term alarm and its validation as well as the identification of the type of threat. \n\nSince most of the bio sensors available are laboratory bound or require special equipment which needs training as well as experience, new systems are needed. The concept of BIO-PROTECT is the development of a fast-alert, easy-to-use device to be applied for detection and identification of airborne bacteria, spores, viruses and toxins. Its technology is based on bioaerosol detection by fluorescence, scattering and background aerosol measurement followed by ionization of air flow and analysis of the spectrum of relative speed of passage, which, in turns, enables identification of harmful biological agents. This device may also be used for controlling potential accidental release of bio-agents from biotechnology laboratories.\n",

A BRIDGE platform provides technical support for multi-agency collaboration in large-scale emergency relief efforts. The key to this is to ensure interoperability, harmonisation and cooperation among stakeholders on the technical and organisational level.\n\nThe vision of the BRIDGE project is to \n-\tFacilitate cross-border and cross-agency collaboration; \n-\tAllow the creation of a common, comprehensive, and reliable operational picture of the incident site; \n-\tEnable integration of resources and technologies into workflow management; \n-\tEnable active ad-hoc participation of third parties.\n\nBRIDGE uses the middleware concept. This means that a single software layer lies between different tools and applications (developed by BRIDGE or other projects). It provides certain standard of development within the middleware and the developers have control on which applications are and are not integrated. The following BRIDGE Concept Cases have been validated in BRIDGE ValEDation Days in September and November 2014:\n\n-\tAdvanced Situation Awareness (Situation Awareness using UAV and software);\n-\tDynamic Tagging (Situation awareness using a tagging system for marking and monitoring significant locations of the disaster location) ;\n-\tFRITS (First Responders Integrated Training System);\n-\tInformation Intelligence (data gathering);\n-\tMaster (assists in keeping a common operational picture among central actors during an incident.);\n-\tRobust and Resilient Communication main functionalities: \n1.\tWireless Mesh routers that form an ad-hoc network (called the BRIDGE Mesh) to provide a networking infrastructure for other systems on the scene (e.g., eTriage)\n2.\tThe HelpBeacons application that allows people to call for help using an Android smart phone.\n3.\tThe HelpBeacons Seeker application that is used by first responders to collect SOS messages.\n-\tSWARM (Situation aWAre Resource Management)\n\nFor more information about the above mentioned tools visit: http://www.bridgeproject.eu/en/bridge-results/concept-cases\n",

All eight concept cases, plus the BRIDGE middleware, were shown at different timeslots of the BRIDGE Golden Hour, demonstrating both, the advantages of the new technologies and early stage prototypes in different phases of emergency response and their interaction and interoperability as an integrated solution.

The main objective of DARIUS is to reach effective levels of interoperability so these systems can be shared between several organisations. This objective will be achieved in designing a Generic Ground Station with associated proposed standards, a full integration in the command and control cycle and a consistent communication network. In addition, DARIUS will adapt the existing unmanned systems and their payloads (air, ground and maritime) to the specificities of the Search and Rescue missions. DARIUS solutions will be evaluated in real conditions through three scenarios (urban, forest fires and maritime SAR).\n![Darius](img/darius.jpg)\n",

A negative usability aspects is the high costs. The citizen safety market is very fragmented and each agency has a very limited budget. Another negative usability aspect is the fact that first responders will be legally responsible for their actions, but are reluctant to transfer some of their responsibilities to machines.

Furthermore, CBRN  contamination risks can occur as a consequence of these events. Regions affected are wider and wider and reconstruction and recovery operations are longer-lasting, costly and complex, especially when decontamination is necessary. \n\nDESTRIERO aims at developing a next generation post-crisis needs assessment tool for reconstruction and recovery planning, including structural damage assessment through advanced remote sensing enriched by in-field data collection by mobile devices (buildings, bridges, dams) and related data integration and analysis, based on international standards, novel (automated) data and information interoperability across organisations and systems, in combination with an advanced multi-criteria decision analysis tool and methodology for multi-stakeholder information analyses, priority setting, decision making and recovery planning. Earth observation images will contribute to fast damage assessment and monitoring of the areas, together with data acquired by relief units on the field using novel smart-phone apps. Identified needs will be recorded, stored and made available to all organisations involved.\n\nDESTRIERO has four objectives: \n1.\tFaster and better damage assessment for planning and monitoring of progress of recovery.\n2.\tFacilitate fast and intuitive access for distributed users to visualise the dynamic “common operational picture”, during the planning and reconstruction period.\n3.\tBetter collaborative decision making during the planning and reconstruction phase Support standardisation of assessment data, interoperability between different information systems from stakeholders and capabilities to compare damage and recovery requirements towards prioritisation and joint decision making.\n4.\tImprove management information in relation to PDNA and RRP DESTRIERO will provide a single access point and on-line library with PDNA and RRP Frameworks, high level overviews of planned and running recovery projects including multi-donor funding information and the possibility to trace related surveillance data for progress monitoring.\n",
