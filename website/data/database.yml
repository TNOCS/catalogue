      A4A aims to improve crucial communication of information to the population (Early warning systems) through alert message dissemination using different communication systems, from cell phone messages and radio transmissions to Wi-Fi broadcasts and broadband Internet though a pan-European agency.
      
      ![A4A](img/alert4all.png)
    
      The ‘Alert and communications framework’ aims to:
      - Endorse cooperation and information exchange among involved authorities by means of common interfaces;
      - Provide decision support by means of alert impact awareness tools: 
        - (i) an alert impact what-if simulation tool that can be applied for planning purposes; 
        - (ii) real-time screening of new media posts, providing knowledge on citizens&quot; perception to authorities;
      - Foster cost-effective alert message dissemination over a variety of communication systems, including satellite links, by means of novel communication protocols that promote the use of harmonised best practices.

            The main objective of A4A is to improve early warning capabilities across Europe. It aims at laying the foundations for a 
            pan-European alerting system. Using this system authorities will be able to warn the population during large scale crises. 
            As soon as the thread is recognised, civil protection officials can describe the situation by selecting key words in the 
            system. A4A then automatically composes a coded alert message from these key words in any language. A4A has a great potential
            to solve this gap, it should be noted however, that the described goals can only be achieved in the long term. Therefore this 
            project is rated [2/3].

            A4A aims at laying the foundations for a pan-European alerting system. Using this system authorities can quickly and efficiently
            compose  and disseminate messages to the public. The alert message dissemination uses many communication technologies that are
            triggered centrally by a satellite communication system called: ‘Global Alerting Gateway’. This ensures the alert message reaches
            the maximum number of people at risk. A4A has a great potential to solve this gap, it should be noted however, that the described
            goals can only be achieved in the long term. Therefore this project is rated at [2/3].

        remarks: |
            The system not only aims to warn the population, but also aims to disseminate information between agencies using A4A. A4A only 
            focusses on exchanging information during crises, and as mentioned earlier the stated goals are only possible in the long term. 
            For these reasons the project is rated at [1/3].

            A4A provides a solution to monitor how the public reacts to an alarm. A4A systems’ “screening new media tool’” gathers and analyses, 
            in real time, opinions about the emergency expressed by the affected public. This allows civil protection officials to make educated 
            decisions based on the growing context of the situation. Potentially this system will be able to solve this gap when social media is 
            the ‘external source’. It should be noted however, that the described goals can only be achieved in the long term. Therefore this 
            project is rated [2/3].

            A4A will offer an e-learning platform.  Using the ‘training mode’ in the A4A system civil protection officials will be able to 
            practise the use of all systems’ functionalities. This platform ensures harmonisation of training the use of this alert system. 
            Every civil protection official will be trained in the same way and in their own language. It should be noted however, that the 
            platform only provides a tutorial for the use of this system and that the mentioned goals can only be achieved in the long term.
            For these reasons the project is rated at [1/3].

      remarks: |
        The system has been demonstrated in an operational environment. Results of this demonstration show that, potentially, the system could 
        be very user friendly. The actual usability (affordability, openness of the solution etc.) of A4A is not clear, because a pan-European 
        service (European Warning and Informing Agency) has not been established yet. As mentioned before, the possibilities of using this 
        system will only be available in the long term.
