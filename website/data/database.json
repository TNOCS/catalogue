The project emphasis was on cascading events that can cause catastrophic outages of the electric power systems.\n![A4A](img/after.png)\n\nSpecifically the following objectives were pursued:\n\n1. Define and develop the architecture of a framework for risk and vulnerability assessment for integrated power and ICT systems.\n2. Develop methodologies for dealing with risk and vulnerability in integrated power and ICT systems. \n3. Develop tools and techniques for dealing with risk and vulnerability in integrated power and ICT systems:\n   - Develop prototype tools to support global risk assessment incorporating hazard, vulnerability and impact analysis\n   - Develop techniques to support the defence of critical infrastructures against unwanted (included cascading)events\n   - Develop a decision support system for intelligent automatic restoration, e.g. after wide spread blackouts.\n4. Develop the concepts and techniques for physical security:\n   - Develop sensing, monitoring and software agent technologies for security monitoring and early warning.     \n",

A physical security management tool is devoted to detect and to provide early warning of physical intrusions into energy system facilities including power plants and substations. The system tracks potential intruders via advanced algorithms to manage cameras: any alarm is processed and associated with a list of possible intrusion hypotheses on the basis of an encoded set of rules. Power flow analyses estimate the impact of any attack scenario on the grid and suggest operational practices to limit the impact itself. A drill at CEPS premises provided raw data to validate the tool performance. \n\nThe tool provides early warning capabilities with respect to detecting physical intrusions in energy system facilities. Early warning capabilities with respect to detecting and warning about non- physical (cyber-) attacks is not mentioned in the project description. \n"

Using the tools provided by AFTER TSOs will be able to predict and minimise the cascading effects of grid failures caused by man- made or natural incidents. AFTER also provides tools to restart the affected grid as soon as possible. The following tools or algorithms are developed:   \n- An adaptive multi-agent-based load shedding algorithm is proposed to mitigate power system blackouts using various types of IED (Intelligent Electronic Device ), improving the frequency response with respect to conventional schemes. \n- The defence support tool integrates a dynamic security assessment tool with a Case Based Reasoning (CBR) algorithm: after the analysis of many network scenarios, and large set of contingencies (assessing possibly needed remedial measures), the CBR is able to find an appropriate measure for critical contingency in an electrical network to avoid black out. \n- The restoration support tool, based on Generic Restoration Milestones (GRMs), has the following features: \n  - overall objective is to minimize the system restoration time; \n  - optimization techniques compute solutions for different restoration tasks; \n  - adaptive construction of restoration strategies. \n"

Develop methodologies for dealing with risk and vulnerability in integrated power and ICT systems:\n   - Establish methods for describing vulnerability and criticality of various parts of the system, taking various types of barriers/ protection into account\n   - Establish methods for impact (consequence) analysis, including the impact of cascading events\n   - Provide an approach for risk estimation and assessment, suggest ways to quantify risk and to establish acceptance criteria\n   - Establish main elements and algorithms of defence plans\n   - Establish main elements and algorithms of restoration plans.\n\nThe lack of harmonisation in risk assessment with respect to ICT and power grid risks is solved if these objectives are achieved. \n"
